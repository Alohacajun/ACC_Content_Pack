Compatibility & Notes
-
**4 December 2019**
- Please note that this mod does not change the player character. Other mods may work, but Stardew valley 1.4.x breaks a lot of clothing related mods. 
 - Genderswaps are not yet compatible with Stardew Valley patch 1.4.x. The next update will fix the Genderswaps. 
 - Translation files should no longer be required for those playing ACC in a non-English language. The files are now contained within the base mod.
 - Compatibility mods for others such as Longevity are not updated and as such will not likely work with the updated Stardew Valley patch 1.4.x

 Installation
 -
1. Before installing ACC, make sure you have the following installed:
 [SMAPI 3.0.1](https://smapi.io/) -- Required to use Content Patcher
 [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915) -- Allows easy installation and removal of ACC
 2. Download the ACC mod from this repository [here](https://github.com/Alohacajun/ACC_Content_Pack/archive/master.zip).
